# SAMP Admin Panel

## Introduction  
SAMP Admin Panel is a tool that helps administrators manage **San Andreas Multiplayer (SAMP)** servers easily. It utilizes the [`samp-query`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/samp-query) library to communicate with the server's RCON, allowing actions such as checking server status, viewing player lists, sending RCON commands, and more.  

## Features  
- Connect and retrieve information from a SAMP server.  
- View the list of online players.  
- Send RCON commands directly from the toolâ€™s interface.  
- Monitor server status: player count, ping, etc.  
- Modify IP, RCON password, and port directly from the tool.
